# Digit-Generation-Using-VAE
This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow/Keras to generate new digit images similar to those in the MNIST dataset. A VAE is a type of generative model that learns to encode input data into a latent space and then decode it back, allowing new samples to be generated by sampling from this latent space.
